# Kixago DeFi Credit Intelligence Platform

**The Credit Bureau for Decentralized Finance**

---

## Executive Summary

Kixago is **the first real-time credit intelligence platform for crypto-native borrowers**. We provide FICO-style credit scores (300-850 range), liquidation risk analysis, and actionable recommendations based on a wallet's complete DeFi lending history across all protocols and chains.

### The Opportunity

**$50B+** in DeFi lending positions exist today, yet:
- ‚ùå Banks **cannot underwrite** crypto-native borrowers
- ‚ùå Wealth advisors **cannot verify** client DeFi holdings
- ‚ùå Developers spend **2-3 weeks** integrating each protocol
- ‚ùå Traders **miss liquidation opportunities** due to fragmented data

### Our Solution

**One API call** returns:
- ‚úÖ **DeFi Credit Score** (300-850, like FICO)
- ‚úÖ **Complete position data** across Aave, Compound, MakerDAO
- ‚úÖ **Multi-chain aggregation** (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon)
- ‚úÖ **Risk factor analysis** with severity levels
- ‚úÖ **Liquidation scenarios** (what-if price drop modeling)
- ‚úÖ **Actionable recommendations** (immediate, short-term, long-term)

**Response time:** 1-2 seconds  
**Developer integration time:** 5 minutes

---

## The Problem: The DeFi Credit Invisibility Gap

### Traditional Finance Has Credit Bureaus

When a borrower applies for a loan, lenders check:
- **FICO Score** (300-850 range)
- **Credit History** (bankruptcies, late payments)
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**
- **Report Time:** 3-5 days
- **Cost:** $30-50 per check

**Result:** Lenders can underwrite with confidence.

---

### DeFi Has NO Credit Bureau

When a crypto-native borrower seeks financing:
- ‚ùå No standardized credit score
- ‚ùå DeFi positions invisible to traditional finance
- ‚ùå No way to verify leverage or liquidation risk
- ‚ùå Manual analysis takes days (if possible at all)

**Result:** Banks decline crypto-native borrowers, even if they have $10M+ in DeFi collateral.

---

### The Data Fragmentation Problem

A single wallet might have positions across:

| Protocol | Chains | APIs Required |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Aave V2** | Ethereum, Polygon | 2 integrations |
| **Aave V3** | Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon | 4 integrations |
| **Compound V2** | Ethereum | 1 integration |
| **Compound V3** | Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon | 4 integrations |
| **MakerDAO** | Ethereum | 1 integration |
| **TOTAL** | ‚Äî | **12 separate integrations** |

**Each integration requires:**
- Custom ABI decoding
- Chain-specific RPC calls
- Token price oracles
- Health factor calculations
- USD value normalization

**Time required:** 2-3 weeks per protocol √ó 5 protocols = **~3 months**

---

## Our Solution: DeFi Credit Intelligence API

Kixago provides **the credit bureau layer** for decentralized finance.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**No integration work. No multi-chain complexity. Just answers.**

## DeFi Credit Scoring Methodology

### The 5-Factor Scoring Model (300-850 Range)

Our proprietary scoring algorithm evaluates 5 weighted components:

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Health Factor | 40% | Proximity to liquidation |
| Leverage Ratio | 30% | Debt-to-collateral ratio (LTV) |
| Diversification | 15% | Concentration risk (assets & protocols) |
| Volatility Exposure | 10% | Collateral asset risk profile |
| Protocol Risk | 5% | Smart contract maturity |

**Formula:**

```
Internal Score (0-100) = Œ£(Component Score √ó Weight)
Final Score = (Internal Score √ó 5.5) + 300
```

**Result:** FICO-style score between 300-850

---

### Component 1: Health Factor Score (40% Weight)

**What it measures:** How close a position is to liquidation.

| Health Factor | Score | Risk Level |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| ‚â• 2.0 | 100 | Extremely safe |
| 1.5 - 2.0 | 80 | Safe |
| 1.3 - 1.5 | 60 | Moderate |
| 1.1 - 1.3 | 40 | Risky |
| 1.0 - 1.1 | 20 | DANGER ZONE |
| < 1.0 | 0 | Liquidated |

**Why 40% weight?** This is the single most important metric in DeFi lending. Below 1.0 = instant liquidation.

---

### Component 2: Leverage Score (30% Weight)

**What it measures:** Loan-to-value ratio (debt √∑ collateral).

| LTV Range | Score | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| 0-30% | 100 | Minimal leverage |
| 31-50% | 80 | Conservative |
| 51-70% | 60 | Moderate |
| 71-85% | 40 | Aggressive |
| 86-95% | 20 | Very aggressive |
| > 95% | 0 | Extreme danger |

**Example:** $1M collateral, $900K debt = 90% LTV = 20 points

---

### Component 3: Diversification Score (15% Weight)

**What it measures:** Concentration risk across assets and protocols.

**Sub-component A: Collateral Concentration (50 pts max)**

- Top asset < 40% of collateral: 50 points
- Top asset 40-60%: 35 points
- Top asset 60-80%: 20 points
- Top asset > 80%: 10 points

**Sub-component B: Protocol Diversification (50 pts max)**

- 3+ protocols: 50 points
- 2 protocols: 35 points
- 1 protocol: 20 points

**Example:** 100% weETH in Aave only = 30/100 (poor diversification)

---

### Component 4: Volatility Exposure Score (10% Weight)

**What it measures:** Risk from holding volatile collateral assets.

**Asset Risk Weights:**

- Stablecoins (USDC, DAI): 1.0x (safest)
- Blue chips (ETH, WBTC): 0.8x (low risk)
- Large caps (AAVE, UNI, LINK): 0.6x (medium risk)
- Liquid staking (weETH, wstETH): 0.5x (higher risk)
- Long-tail assets: 0.3x (highest risk)

**Calculation:**

```
Score = (Œ£(Asset USD Value √ó Risk Weight) / Total Collateral) √ó 100
```

**Example:** $2.2B in weETH (0.5x weight) = 50/100

---

### Component 5: Protocol Risk Score (5% Weight)

**What it measures:** Smart contract and protocol maturity risk.

| Protocol | Version | Score | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-------|-----------|
| Aave | V3 | 95 | Most audited, $10B+ TVL |
| Aave | V2 | 90 | Legacy but battle-tested |
| Compound | V2/V3 | 90 | Proven, well-audited |
| MakerDAO | V1 | 95 | Oldest DeFi protocol |
| Morpho | ‚Äî | 80 | Newer but audited |
| Unknown | ‚Äî | 50 | Higher risk |

Weighted average across all positions.

---

## Real-World Example: The $2.2B Whale

Let's analyze actual wallet `0xf0bb...416C`:

### Position Summary

- **Total Collateral:** $2.2B (weETH)
- **Total Debt:** $1.9B (WETH)
- **Health Factor:** 1.067
- **LTV:** 89%
- **Protocols:** Aave V3 (Ethereum + Base)

### Scoring Breakdown

| Component | Score | Weight | Contribution |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Health Factor | 20/100 | 40% | 8.0 |
| Leverage | 20/100 | 30% | 6.0 |
| Diversification | 45/100 | 15% | 6.75 |
| Volatility | 50/100 | 10% | 5.0 |
| Protocol Risk | 95/100 | 5% | 4.75 |
| **TOTAL** | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | **30.5** |

**Final Score:** (30.5 √ó 5.5) + 300 = **467**

**Risk Level:** üî¥ **HIGH RISK** (450-549 range)

---

### Risk Analysis

#### Critical Risk Factors

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Imminent Liquidation Risk** (-40 pts)
  - Health factor 1.067 = liquidation at 6.7% price drop
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Extreme Leverage** (-30 pts)
  - 89% LTV leaves minimal safety buffer
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Concentration Risk** (-15 pts)
  - 100% of collateral in single asset (weETH)

#### Liquidation Scenarios

| Event | New Health Factor | Status | Loss Estimate |
|-------|------------------|---------|---------------|
| ETH drops 5% | 1.014 | Near liquidation | ‚Äî |
| ETH drops 10% | 0.961 | LIQUIDATED | $218M penalty |
| ETH drops 20% | 0.854 | LIQUIDATED | $326M penalty |

---

### Recommendations

**Immediate (< 24 hours):**

- üö® Deposit $387M more collateral, OR
- üö® Repay $291M debt to reduce LTV below 70%

**Short-term (1 week):**

- Diversify across Compound, Morpho
- Convert 20% to stablecoins

**Long-term:**

- Maintain health factor > 2.0
- Target LTV < 50%

---

## Use Cases: Who Uses Kixago?

const risk = await kixago.getRiskProfile('0xBorrower...');

if (risk.defi_score >= 700 && risk.global_health_factor > 2.0) {
  return 'APPROVED - Low risk DeFi profile';
} else if (risk.defi_score < 550) {
  return 'DECLINED - High liquidation risk';
}
```

**Impact:** Banks can now underwrite crypto-native borrowers with confidence.

---

### 2. Wealth Advisors (Portfolio Verification)

**Problem:** Client claims "$50M in DeFi yield farming" - how do you verify?

**Kixago Solution:**

```typescript
const profile = await kixago.getRiskProfile('client.eth');

// Show complete breakdown:
// - All positions across chains
// - Current yields
// - Liquidation risk
// - Recommended actions
```

**Impact:** Turn DeFi oversight into billable advisory services.

---

### 3. Developers (Rapid Integration)

for (const whale of whales) {
  const risk = await kixago.getRiskProfile(whale);
  
  if (risk.global_health_factor < 1.15) {
    alert(`Liquidation opportunity: ${whale} 
           Collateral: $${risk.total_collateral_usd}
           Buffer: ${risk.defi_score.liquidation_simulation.buffer_percentage}%`);
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Sub-100ms response times enable real-time monitoring.
